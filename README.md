# Solution and Reasoning
 1. All that was asked was a max_occ and unique_length. Otherwise I would have rendered a tree mapping representative of the call that was done over fragmented API calls.

 2. Object mapping was the easiest method to be readable and give final values. Promise.all was used (this was vanilla otherwise a method similar to the aggregate axios method would have been used).

# Additional Info if Needed
Can render a tree representation client side if required or if the solution would like to be realized in another language.
